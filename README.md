# MeetingManager

Meeting manager is s a tool intended for usage by organizers and activists for an easier meeting experience.  This is an experimental application is not ready for widespread usage, however if you're a developer I highly encourage you to take a look around and play with the currently functional backend!  Below you'll find API and other miscellaneous documentation.

## API

This app is currently not hosted on any package manager, you'll have to clone this repo and run the following command before launching:

```
npm install
```

Currently this is no hosted backend for this app so you'll have to host it locally on your own box.  You can launch the backend with the following command:

```
node controller/controller
```
